# Medical Terms for Analysts

A personal learning project to build fluency in **medical terminology** with a focus on practical use in the **health insurance industry**.  

As a data scientist, I often analyze hospital, medical, and ancillary claim data. This repo is my structured way to understand the language behind those claims, so I can bridge **clinical concepts** with **data and analytics**.
