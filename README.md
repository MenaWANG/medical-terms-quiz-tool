# Medical Terms Learning Project

This is my personal learning project to build fluency in **medical terminology**. Please feel free to use it, contribute to it, or fork it to create your own terminology learning project. 🤗   

As a data scientist who wants to use my skill to do good, I am always fascinated by healthcare data: there is so much to analyze to serve humanity. 🙌 This repo is my structured way to understand medical language, to help me, or anyone else interested, to bridge **clinical concepts** with **data and analytics**. 💖
