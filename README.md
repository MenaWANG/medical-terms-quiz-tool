# Medical-Terms-Quiz-Tool

As a data scientist who wants to use my skill to do good, I am always fascinated by healthcare data: there is so much to analyze to serve the world. 🙌 Therefore, I built this quiz tool to help myself, or anyone else interested, to learn, review and build fluency in **medical terminology**. 💖

This is my personal project open-sourced for everyone. Please feel free to use it, contribute to it, or fork it to create your own terminology learning tool in any domain of interests. 🤗
