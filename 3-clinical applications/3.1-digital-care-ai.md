## 💡 Technical Implementation Examples

### Electronic Health Records
```
// Example HL7 FHIR Patient Resource in JSON format
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "example",
  "active": true,
  "name": [
    {
      "use": "official",
      "family": "Smith",
      "given": ["John", "Adam"]
    }
  ],
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1974-12-25"
}
```

### Digital Twin Implementation
```
// Simplified example of a cardiovascular model component
function calculateCardiacOutput(heartRate, strokeVolume) {
  // CO = HR × SV
  return heartRate * strokeVolume;
}

function predictBloodPressure(cardiacOutput, systemicVascularResistance) {
  // MAP = CO × SVR
  return cardiacOutput * systemicVascularResistance;
}
```

### Telemedicine Architecture
```
// Simplified system architecture diagram
Patient Device → Encrypted Channel → Healthcare Provider Platform
     ↓                                      ↓
