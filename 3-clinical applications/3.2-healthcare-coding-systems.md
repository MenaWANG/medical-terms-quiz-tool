## üßæ Definitions & Technical Breakdown
| System | Definition | Structure | Primary Use Cases | Current Version |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **ICD** | International standard for reporting diseases and health conditions | Alphanumeric codes organized by body system and disease type | Diagnosis coding, mortality statistics, epidemiology | ICD-10-CM (Clinical Modification), ICD-11 (implementing) |
| **MDC** | Major Diagnostic Categories - first-level division of all diagnoses into 25 body system categories | Mutually exclusive categories primarily organized by body system | First step in DRG assignment, hospital service line organization | 25 categories in current MS-DRG system |
| **DRG** | Patient classification system for hospital reimbursement | Groups based on diagnoses, procedures, age, complications | Hospital payment, resource utilization analysis | MS-DRG v40.0 (Medicare Severity DRGs) |
| **HCPCS** | Standardized coding for healthcare procedures, equipment, supplies | Level I (CPT), Level II (alphanumeric for supplies, non-physician services) | Healthcare billing, durable medical equipment | HCPCS 2023 |

  - MDC 22: Burns
  - MDC 23: Factors Influencing Health Status & Other Contacts with Health Services
  - MDC 24: Multiple Significant Trauma
  - MDC 25: Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infections
- **Assignment Process**: Based on the principal diagnosis ICD code
- **Purpose**: Organizes hospital services by clinical specialty and body system
- **International Usage**: Concept used globally but with country-specific implementations

#### DRG System
- **Base Components**: 
  1. MDC assignment (first step)
  2. Severity adjustments (e.g., complications and comorbidities)
  3. Relative weight values
- **Calculation Factors**:
  - Principal diagnosis (ICD code)
  - Surgical procedures performed
  - Comorbidities and complications
  - Age, sex, and discharge disposition
- **Example Flow**:
  1. Principal diagnosis: Pneumonia (ICD-10 J18.9)
  2. MDC assignment: MDC 04 (Respiratory System)
  3. DRG determination: 193 - Simple Pneumonia without CC/MCC
  4. Payment calculation: Base rate √ó DRG weight
- **International Variants**:
  - US: MS-DRGs (Medicare Severity)
  - Australia: AR-DRGs (Australian Refined)
  - Germany: G-DRGs (German)
  - UK: HRGs (Healthcare Resource Groups)

### HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System)
- **Level Structure**:
  - Level I: CPT codes (maintained by AMA)
  - Level II: National codes for supplies, materials, services not in CPT
- **Code Format**: 
  - Level I: Five-digit numeric codes (e.g., 99213)
  - Level II: One letter followed by four digits (e.g., A4253)
- **Categories**:
  - A codes: Transportation, Medical & Surgical Supplies
  - B codes: Enteral and Parenteral Therapy
  - E codes: Durable Medical Equipment
  - G codes: Procedures/Professional Services
  - J codes: Drugs Administered Other Than Oral Method
  - K codes: Temporary Codes
  - L codes: Orthotic and Prosthetic Procedures
  - M codes: Medical Services
  - P codes: Pathology and Laboratory
  - Q codes: Temporary codes
  - R codes: Diagnostic Radiology Services
  - S codes: Temporary National Codes (Non-Medicare)
  - T codes: National T codes established for State Medicaid Agencies
  - V codes: Vision and Hearing Services
- **Example**: J0696 (Injection, ceftriaxone sodium, per 250 mg)
- **Updates**: Quarterly updates
- **International Relevance**: While primarily US-based, the concepts and structure inform procedure coding systems in other countries
